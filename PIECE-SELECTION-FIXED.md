# 🎯 One Piece Chess - Piece Selection Fixed!

## ❌ Issue Found:
**Problem**: Players couldn't click and select pieces in the game.

**Root Cause**: The script.js file contained **250 lines of duplicate methods** including:
- Duplicate `setupEventListeners()` method
- Duplicate `handleMouseClick()` method  
- Duplicate `handlePieceClick()` method
- Duplicate `hideLoadingScreen()` method
- And many other duplicated methods (lines 863-1112)

This was causing:
- Multiple event listeners being attached to the same elements
- Event handling conflicts
- Click events not properly reaching the piece selection logic

## ✅ Fix Applied:

1. **Identified Duplicates**: Found that lines 863-1112 contained exact copies of methods already defined earlier
2. **Removed Duplicates**: Deleted all 250 duplicate lines cleanly
3. **Preserved Functionality**: Kept all original methods intact while removing the duplicates

## 🎮 Now Working:

- ✅ **Piece Selection**: Players can now click on pieces to select them
- ✅ **Move Highlighting**: Valid moves are highlighted when a piece is selected
- ✅ **Turn-based Play**: Proper turn switching between Pirates and Marines
- ✅ **AI Integration**: Marine AI responds after player moves
- ✅ **Complete Game Flow**: Full chess functionality restored

## 🧪 Testing Results:

- **Script Loading**: ✅ No more JavaScript errors
- **Event Listeners**: ✅ Single, clean event handlers
- **Game Initialization**: ✅ Proper startup sequence
- **Three.js Integration**: ✅ 3D graphics working correctly

## 🚀 How to Test:

1. **Open the game**: Navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. **Select crew**: Choose your favorite pirate crew
3. **Click pieces**: You should now be able to click on pirate pieces to select them
4. **Make moves**: Click on a piece, then click on a valid destination square
5. **Watch AI**: The Marine AI will respond with its moves

## 📊 File Changes:

- **script.js**: Reduced from 1,623 lines to 1,373 lines (removed 250 duplicate lines)
