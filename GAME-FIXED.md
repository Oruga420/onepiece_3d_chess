# 🎮 One Piece 3D Chess - Game Fixed! 

## ❌ Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Critical JavaScript Error (FIXED)**
- **Problem**: Variable named `eval` in script.js (reserved keyword in strict mode)
- **Location**: Lines 249, 255, 256, 269, 275, 276 in script.js
- **Fix**: Renamed `eval` variable to `evaluation` throughout the code
- **Impact**: This was preventing the entire game from loading

### 2. **Three.js Loading Issues (FIXED)**
- **Problem**: Game relied on CDN loading of Three.js which can be blocked
